Introduction
============

There are three kinds of places in the world: Those that ban drone use by journalists, those that heavily restrict it and those that haven't even considered it yet. 

In the US, it's banned.

In the UK, Canada, parts of Scandinavia and Australia, it's possible to get permission from civil aviation authorities to do journalism with a UAV. The rules change by the place -- some places are easier to get permission than others -- but generally speaking, drone journalism is possible. 

In vast swaths of the world, however, there is no law permitting or banning drone use by journalists or anyone else for that matter. The concept has either not occurred to them yet or not risen on the legislative priority list.
