Meteorology Drone, Adam Houston, METR Ph. D. Interview on Jan. 25 2013

Tempest Unmanned Drone, 10.5 feet by 5 feet, commercial

Soaring glider, fiberglass

Lightweight, autopilot

Sensors examine temperature, moisture, sensor wind velocity measure via s-port probe


6 drones would fly into super cells and into vortexes looking at tornadogenesis. Several flights, coordinated with others 

Never had any problems, winds up to 50 knots, up to 25 meters per second, 

Aircraft was fine, upward motion didn’t bother it, could stand 15K updrafts

45 min flight

glider provides more endurance— functions on kinetic energy of the atmosphere

Looking to study the rear flank downdraft. Casual link assumed w/tornadogenesis


Hopes to connect it to forecasting,


Houston has multimedia.
