Drone Journalism Manual
=======================

This manual will attempt to begin to codify the practice of using small flying vehicles to report news, as well as guide news organizations on how to develop their own best practies. The manual, in it's current configuration, is divided into four parts.

1. Introduction, history and the state of the art
2. The Law and the ethics
3. Operations
4. The future 

The laws surrounding the commerical use of UAVs are going to change dramatically over the next few years. This manual's hosting on GitHub is no accident. It will be updated iteratively. Your input is welcome. 

This first version is a prototype, funded by a grant from the Knight Foundation.
