The long history of drone journalism
====================

> All this being arranged, it is only necessary to send the camera up to any desired altitude and pull the camera cord, in order to get photographs of wide-stretching landscapes, extensive cities, like New York, and panoramas of every description. Such photographs could not but be of the greatest value to geologists, mountain climbers, surveyors, and explorers. And they must possess particular interest for students of geography and for map-makers.

If past is prologue, drone journalism started in 1882. And it started because manned options at the time were dangerous, comparatively expensive, difficult and unavailable to everyone who wanted into the air.

But to get there, a few ideas had to be connected together.

* Kites had been around since the 5th Century, invented in China. 
* The first manned balloon flight -- the first real manned flight -- was Nov. 21, 1783 in Paris, and it launched a thousand ideas that would shape modern aviation. 
* In 1839, the daguerreotype camera was completed, allowing images to be fixed and ushering in the age of photography.

It was a matter of time before flight and photography would be connected. And it came in 1858 over Paris, France. The first aerial image was captured by Gaspard-Félix Tournachon from a balloon and aerial photography was born.

But almost as soon as it was invented, innovators started to work on how to remove people from the equation. Balloons could only go where the wind took them. And, early on, they weren't exactly safe. 

Kites were the first Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. And in 1882, British meteorologist E.D. Archibald used an explosive charge to trigger a camera's shutter onboard a kite, and the first drone photo was taken. 

Getting clear images in the early days wasn't easy -- cameras were a new invention, requring a steady hand and ideal conditions to get a clear image. In 1882, Arthur Batut wrote the first book about kite photography, La Photographie Aérienne par Cerf-Volant, which documented his experiments. 

Almost a decade and a half later, the March 1896 issue of McClure's Magazine featured a short biography of Abraham Lincoln, assassinated 31 years before publication, written by famed journalist Ida Tarbell. 

But deeper in the magazine were 12 pages dedicated to the subject of scientific kites. Scholars of the time were using kites to study subjects like the weather by constructing large box kites capable of carrying heavy equipment, and even people.

On May 30, 1895, W.A. Eddy of Bayonne, N.J. captured what the magazine called the first clearly focused photos from a kite in the U.S., featuring aerial views of turn of the century New York City, including City Hall, Frankfort Street and the East River.

"Such photographs could not but be of the greatest value to geologists, mountain climbers, surveyors, and explorers," author Cleveland Moffett wrote. "And they must possess particular interest for students of geography and for map-makers."

Much of our modern understanding of aerial photography is driven by war. Drones are no different.

The Wright Brothers first flight happened Dec. 17, 1903. World War I broke out just 11 years later, and was the first major conflict involving aircraft, and aerial photography. World War II, with quantum leaps in technological capabilities, only accelereated the ideas behind pictures from the air. 

But it was the Korean War that drove the next milestone in drone journalism's history. In Korea, the US military made the first widespread use of helicopters, mostly to evacuate injuried soldiers from the battlefield. 

The end of the war meant thousands of surplus helicopters would now be available in the civilian airspace. Companies offering helicopter flight services for aerial survey's were sprining up all over America. 

In 1958, KTLA's Chief Engineer John Silva was thinking about what the next leap forward in the young television news industry would be. And it struck him: Live TV from a helicopter.
