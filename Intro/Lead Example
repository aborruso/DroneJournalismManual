A New Perspective

Muckraking was once thought to be the centerpiece of journalism. The idea of holding people accountable— and exposing corruption— has lured many people into the field.

In the modern day, old-fashioned muckraking is much more difficult and sometimes requires a new perspective.

In January of 2012, a man flying a small unmanned aircraft noticed something out of the ordinary in Dallas, Texas.  He flew the drone behind a meatpacking company, the area was described as having an odd odor. Using a camera attached to his drone, he took pictures of a creek that led into to the Trinity River— it was red with blood.

The creek was located behind the Columbia Packing Company, a pig slaughterhouse.

An investigation by the Texas Environmental Crimes Task Force found a sewer pipe was clogged, which caused blood to leak into the river. Once the news reached city hall, a legal battle ensued. In March, the Columbia Packing Company decided to close.

Without the information provided by the drone, it isn’t very likely the environmental hazard would be found. The river of blood example proves that drones can be used as another tool for gathering information. 

For journalists, the use of drones allows for a new perspective. Drones can provide new forms of video and pictures and go places that are not safe for people. Investing in this technology furthers the industry and expands the potential for news organizations.

As with any new technology, drone journalists will face some resistance. By establishing a firm set of ethics and proving the usefulness of drones— drones can be a regular part of journalism just like smartphones and cameras.
