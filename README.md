Drone Journalism Manual
=======================

This manual will attempt to begin to codify the practice of using small flying vehicles to report news, as well as guide news organizations on how to develop their own best practies. The manual, in it's current configuration, is divided into four parts.

1. Introduction, history and the state of the art
2. The Law and the ethics
3. Operations
4. The future 

The laws surrounding the commerical use of UAVs are going to change dramatically over the next few years. This manual's hosting on GitHub is no accident. It will be updated iteratively. Your input is welcome. 

The first versions are a prototype, funded by a grant from the __Knight Foundation__. Significant revisions will occur when the US Federal Aviation Administration files it's notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) regarding small UAVs in the first quarter of 2014 (estimated). 

##Current version: 0.0##

We will increment minor releases here, and major releases will be output as epub files and other formats regularly.
