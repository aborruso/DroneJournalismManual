#Introduction

Let's be clear: There are few places on Earth where Drone Journalism is fully legal. 

There are few countries with established aviation policy that allows for the commercial use of unmanned aerial vehicles, known as drones. There are few places with privacy laws that take drones into account.

There are now places where lawmakers are making Drone Journalism illegal, without the first journalist able to legally try it.

But what is Drone Journalism? To answer that, you have to understand what a drone is, and how it might be useful to do journalism.

In the first part of this manual, we'll do the following: 

* Describe the controvery over what makes a drone a drone
* Discuss the fights over the word drone
* Show the state of the technology and how that relates to journalists

In the second part, we'll show what could be done with drones for journalism. We will:

* Describe how we used a drone to cover drought in Nebraska
* Show case studies of how drones might be used in other kinds of news coverage
* Detail best practices learned in our experiments

In the third part, we'll discuss the multitude of rules, regulations and ethical issues that drones force journalists to consider.

* Aviation policy across the globe is in flux because of drones. We'll look at several nations, focusing on the US.
* 43 states in the US are considering or have already passed their own laws regarding drones in local airspace. Texas has all but criminalized drone journalism.
* It's tempting to believe new technology means new ethical rules, but many long-held ethical principles apply to drones. But what does change when more journalists can get in the air?
