The long history of drone journalism
====================

> All this being arranged, it is only necessary to send the camera up to any desired altitude and pull the camera cord, in order to get photographs of wide-stretching landscapes, extensive cities, like New York, and panoramas of every description. Such photographs could not but be of the greatest value to geologists, mountain climbers, surveyors, and explorers. And they must possess particular interest for students of geography and for map-makers.

If past is prologue, drone journalism started in 1882. And it started because manned options at the time were dangerous, comparatively expensive, difficult and unavailable to everyone who wanted into the air.

But to get there, a few ideas had to be connected together.

* Kites had been around since the 5th Century, invented in China. 
* The first manned balloon flight -- the first real manned flight -- was Nov. 21, 1783 in Paris, and it launched a thousand ideas that would shape modern aviation. 
* In 1839, the daguerreotype camera was first used, allowing images to be fixed and ushering in the age of photography.

It was a matter of time before flight and photography would be connected. And it came in 1858 over Paris, France. The first aerial image was captured by Gaspard-Félix Tournachon from a balloon and aerial photography was born.

But almost as soon as it was invented, innovators started to work on how to remove people from the equation. Balloons could only go where the wind took them. And, early on, they weren't exactly safe. Nor were they very plentiful. 

Enter kites.

Kites were the first Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. And in 1882, British meteorologist E.D. Archibald used an explosive charge to trigger a camera's shutter onboard a kite, and the first drone photo was taken. 

Getting clear images in the early days wasn't easy -- cameras were a new invention, requring a steady hand and ideal conditions to get a clear image. In 1882, Arthur Batut wrote the first book about kite photography, La Photographie Aérienne par Cerf-Volant, which documented his experiments. 

Almost a decade and a half later, the March 1896 issue of McClure's Magazine featured a short biography of Abraham Lincoln, assassinated 31 years before publication, written by famed journalist Ida Tarbell. 

But deeper in the magazine were 12 pages dedicated to the subject of scientific kites. Scholars of the time were using kites to study subjects like the weather by constructing large box kites capable of carrying heavy equipment, and even people.

On May 30, 1895, W.A. Eddy of Bayonne, N.J. captured what the magazine called the first clearly focused photos from a kite in the U.S., featuring aerial views of turn of the century New York City, including City Hall, Frankfort Street and the East River.

"Such photographs could not but be of the greatest value to geologists, mountain climbers, surveyors, and explorers," author Cleveland Moffett wrote. "And they must possess particular interest for students of geography and for map-makers."

Much of our modern understanding of aerial photography is driven by war. Drones are no different.

The Wright Brothers first flight happened Dec. 17, 1903. World War I broke out just 11 years later, and was the first major conflict involving aircraft, and aerial photography. World War II, with quantum leaps in technological capabilities, only accelereated the ideas behind pictures from the air. 

But it was the Korean War that drove the next milestone in drone journalism's history. 

###The Telecopter###

The helicopter was first developed at the end of World War II, but it wasn't until Korea that the vehicle would see widespread use in war. In Korea, they were mostly used to evacuate injuried soldiers from the rocky battlefields of that conflict and they were used in the thousands. 

The end of the war in 1953 meant the companies that built those helicopters for the military would seek civilian markets for the vehicles. Companies offering helicopter flight services for aerial survey's were springing up all over America. 

In 1958, KTLA's Chief Engineer John Silva was thinking about what the next leap forward in the young television news industry would be. And it struck him: Live TV from a helicopter. 

KTLA had successfully broadcast live from the scene of a news event using equipment built into a truck, and in November 1957 they had broadcast an image from a truck going 55 mph on the Harbor Freeway in Los Angeles.

But that equipment weighed 2,000 pounds. The Bell G2 helicopter they were going to use could lift only 400 pounds of camera gear.

The second problem was getting the signal. The signal from the camera to the station had to be line of sight -- aimed at a receiver on top of Mt. Wilson. From the ground, this is a simple operation. From the air -- in three dimensions -- it gets much harder.

So Silva flew to upstate New York to meet with General Electric engineers to figure out how they could aim a signal to the top of a mountain from the air. The trick? It had to be small, light and not consume lots of power. 

[According to the official press materials from the time](http://www.nationalhelicopter.com/telecopter.html) the engineers had three choices:

1. Broadcast the signal in all directions. Problem: Consumes a trmendous amount of power.
2. Using existing signal technology, but on a servo system that could keep the broadcast antenna pointed toward the receiver at all times. Problem: Such a system would be heavy and power hungry.
3. A hybrid model, which would broadcast a signal in all directions horizontally, but would have to be aimed on the vertical axis. This system would use the least power and require the least amount of equipment.

The first test of the system was on July 3, 1958. Hovering at 1,500 feet in the air, the KTLA crew saw nothing. No signal. So Silva unbuckled and climed out onto the skid, where he found that equipment had been damamged during the flight. They landed, repaired the equipment, and on July 4, 1958, they sent the first live pictures from a helicopter.

They named it the Telecopter.

###History Repeating###

The parallels between the Telecopter and today's Drone Journalism are startling:

__Then:__ The KTLA and National Helicopter engineers took a commercial product and hacked it in a workshop.

__Now:__ Hobbyists and engineers all over the world are hacking off the shelf products to produce aerial platforms. 

__Then:__ The KTLA engineers had to shrink camera equipment down to fit under the limits of what the helicopter could lift.

__Now:__ Though orders of magnitude smaller, the same problems exist. Small drones can lift only so much camera, and more gear means more weight.

__Then:__ The last major hurdle KTLA had to overcome was dealing with intense vibrations from the helicopter.

__Now:__ Simple camera mounts that don't include vibration dampening produce video that has a watery wobble to it. DIYers spend significant time dealing with vibrations.
