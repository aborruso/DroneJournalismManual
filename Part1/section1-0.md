Introduction
============

There are three kinds of places in the world: Those that ban drone use by journalists, those that heavily restrict it and those that haven't even considered it yet. 

In the US, it's explicitly banned by aviation regulators (though the legality of that ban is being disuputed in court).

In the UK, Canada, parts of Scandinavia, Japan and Australia, it's possible to get permission from civil aviation authorities to do journalism with a UAV. The rules change by the place -- some places are easier to get permission than others -- but generally speaking, drone journalism is possible. 

In vast swaths of the world, however, there is no law permitting or banning drone use by journalists or anyone else for that matter. The concept has either not occurred to them yet or not risen on the legislative priority list. In some countries, like India, journalists are starting to explore drone use in a vacuum. In other places with less enlightened governments, activists are starting to use small flying cameras to capture images of events and sharing them with the world.

It's tempting to think that we're on the precipice of a revolution, a world where anyone with time and money can have their own flying robot to gather information. In some respects, we are. Never before has the technology been so accessible, the software so good, the costs so low. Things that were impossible are now well within reach.

But there's a long history behind small drones -- and a long history behind using aircraft to do journalism.

The revolution we are on the cusp of witnessing is one of access. More people -- people who will not need expensive and specialized training -- will have the ability to access the skies to do useful things. 

Journalism is a very useful thing. And much can be done from the skies.
