What is drone journalism?
=====

The definition of drone journalism that we in the Drone Journalism Lab use is simple:

> Drone journalism is the use of small unmanned aerial vehicles to gather data, photos and videos as an act of journalism. 

Technology will change and more uses will emerge, but we feel this definition will endure.
